# Sparse-Index-Replication
Sparse index tracking using different target functions and methods in order to meet particular holding contraints. The repository consists of functions and procedures applying algorithm as well as aplicationof them on particular indices. Furthermore it intoduce a new object called portfolio, which allows an efficient storage and analysis results.
 
This repository is more or less an jupyter adaption of cran/sparseIndexTracking. Please refer to this repository for more information.

It is based on "Konstantinos Benidis, Yiyong Feng and Daniel P. Palomar (2018), “Optimization Methods for Financial Index Tracking: From Theory to Practice”, Foundations and Trends R in Optimization: Vol. 3, No. 3, pp 171–279. DOI: 10.1561/2400000021.
Hence please refer to this article for theoretical background
